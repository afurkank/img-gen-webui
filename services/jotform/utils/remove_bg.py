    """
    Remove the background of an image provided as bytes and return the processed image as bytes.

    This function takes an image in the form of bytes, removes its background using the `rembg` 
    library, and returns the resulting image as bytes.

    Args:
        image_bytes (bytes): The image to process in bytes format.

    Returns:
        bytes: The processed image with the background removed.

    Raises:

    Example:
    ```
    with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as image_file:
        image_bytes = image_file.read()
    
    try:
        result_image_bytes = get_bg_removed_img(image_bytes)
        # Use result_image_bytes as needed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    ```

    try:
        output_image = remove(image_bytes)
        return output_image
    except Exception as e:
