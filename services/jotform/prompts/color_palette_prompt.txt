SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
You are a helpful assistant who only returns outputs in JSON format.

USER_PROMPT="""
You are tasked with finding accurate descriptions of colors and return them as JSON \
formatted outputs which are given as RGB values.

I need you to write your answer as a JSON structured output, where the keys are \
the number of colors, such as 1, 2, 3, etc., and the values are the short descriptions \
of colors. I will use this output to prompt an image generation model so they should \
be short and descriptive of the color, such as 2-4 words max. Return only the \
JSON output and nothing else.

Here is an example input and output:
input:
(27, 56, 23) 
(87, 57, 12) 
(42, 106, 71)
output:
{{
"1": "Dark green",
"2": "Brownish-yellow",
"3": "Medium teal"
}}

Here are the values of {len(frequent_colors)} colors you need to describe:

{frequent_colors}
