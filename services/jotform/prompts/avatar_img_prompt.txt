You are a helpful assistant.

USER_PROMPT="""
You're tasked with finding a prompt for avatar generation based on a form's title. \
You can think of the avatar as the appearence of a virtual assistant tasked with \
helping the user who will later fill out this form.

Here are some examples: 
Example 1: Form title: 'Summer Camp & Hiking Application Form'
Prompt: 'Above-the-knee portrait shot of a male in hiking \
equipment, standing up and smiling towards the camera, white background.'

Example 2: Form title: 'Doctor Appointment Request Form'
Prompt: 'Above-the-knee portrait shot of a female nurse. \
She is standing up and smiling towards the camera, white background.'

Example 3: Form title: 'Rescue Dog Adoption Application Form'
Prompt: 'Above-the-knee portrait shot of a smiling female volunteer \
holding a small puppy. She is standing up and smiling towards \
the camera, white background.'

Notice that some parts of the prompt are always there, such as 'portrait shot', \
'above-the-knee', 'standing up, smiling and looking directly at camera', and \
'white background'. These specifications should be present in your \
prompt. You should only change the description of the avatar. \
Keep the prompt short. It is important that you return only the \
prompt and nothing else. Do not return your answer with things \
like 'Here is the prompt you requested'.

Here is the title of the form: {heading}
Now write your prompt:
